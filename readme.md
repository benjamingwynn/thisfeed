ThisFeed
================================================================================

A cool looking way to view a users tweets using HTML5.

API's
=====

ThisFeed uses the following publically avaliable API's:

*jnicol's tweet-php (SKuipers latest working fork)*
*jQuery 1.11*
*jQuery UI*
*daneden's animate.css*

The above listed API's are not included in this repository. They must be
added as referenced in the code if you wish to run your own thisfeed server.

Usage
=====

If you wish to use ThisFeed without having to set up your own server then use my
pre-existing server:

http://gwynn.tk/thisfeed?user=iamxenxier

Feel free to replace iamxenxier with your username, or any other Twitter
user who's tweet can be accessed by anybody.

If you want to run your own ThisFeed server you can do so by installing and
referencing the necessary API's required and running index.php in a  compatible
PHP server.

To view a users tweets use the address:

> /index.php?user=iamxenxier
